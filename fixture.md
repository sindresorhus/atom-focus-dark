Alt-H2

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~


1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.  
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and *Markdown Here* -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. *Markdown Here* supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the [highlight.js demo page](http://softwaremaniacs.org/media/soft/highlight/test.html).

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github).
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
